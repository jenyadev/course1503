use the ls command to list out all of the contents in your "/etc" and your "/run" folder etc > file1.txt run >file2.txt

first use the ls command to list its content and redirect it to file called text1.txt
then do the same with the"/run" folder but for a text file called text2.txt

once we have text1.txt and text2.txt use the cat command to combine them  to a new file called text3.txt

make a new directory and call it dir1, make a txt file with an echo command.

copy or move the text2.txt to dir1 directory.

download and install Docker.


ls /etc >file1.txt
ls/run >file2.txt
catfile1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt
mkdir dir1
echo "this is a test >test.txt
cd ~
cp file2.txt dir1
cd dir1
ls
cd ..
rm file2.txt
